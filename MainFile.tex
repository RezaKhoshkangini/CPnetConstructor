% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***
% *** with production work. IEEE's font choices can trigger bugs that do  ***
% *** not appear when using other class files.                            ***
% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% IEEEtran V1.7 and later provides for these CLASSINPUT macros to allow the
% user to reprogram some IEEEtran.cls defaults if needed. These settings
% override the internal defaults of IEEEtran.cls regardless of which class
% options are used. Do not use these unless you have good reason to do so as
% they can result in nonIEEE compliant documents. User beware. ;)
%
%\newcommand{\CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch}{1.0} % baselinestretch
%\newcommand{\CLASSINPUTinnersidemargin}{1in} % inner side margin
%\newcommand{\CLASSINPUToutersidemargin}{1in} % outer side margin
%\newcommand{\CLASSINPUTtoptextmargin}{1in}   % top text margin
%\newcommand{\CLASSINPUTbottomtextmargin}{1in}% bottom text margin



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[12pt,journal,compsoc]{IEEEtran}
% The Computer Society requires 12pt.
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[10pt,journal,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}


% For Computer Society journals, IEEEtran defaults to the use of 
% Palatino/Palladio as is done in IEEE Computer Society journals.
% To go back to Times Roman, you can use this code:
%\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{ptm}\selectfont





% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  % \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  % \usepackage{cite}
\fi






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

\IEEEcompsocthanksitem Author with Anonymous University.}% <-this % stops a space
\thanks{XXX4}}

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.


% for Computer Society papers, we must declare the abstract and index terms
% PRIOR to the title within the \IEEEtitleabstractindextext IEEEtran
% command as these need to go into the title area created by \maketitle.
% As a general rule, do not put math, special symbols or citations
% in the abstract or keywords.
\IEEEtitleabstractindextext{%
\begin{abstract}
%
\input{abstract} 
%
\end{abstract}

% Note that keywords are not normally used for peerreview papers.
\begin{IEEEkeywords}
Computer Society, IEEEtran, journal, \LaTeX, paper, template.
\end{IEEEkeywords}}


% make the title area
\maketitle


% To allow for easy dual compilation without having to reenter the
% abstract/keywords data, the \IEEEtitleabstractindextext text will
% not be used in maketitle, but will appear (i.e., to be "transported")
% here as \IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext when compsoc mode
% is not selected <OR> if conference mode is selected - because compsoc
% conference papers position the abstract like regular (non-compsoc)
% papers do!
\IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext
% \IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext has no effect when using
% compsoc under a non-conference mode.


% For peerreview papers, this IEEEtran command inserts a page break and
% creates the second title. It will be ignored for other modes.

% biography section
% 
% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
% the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create
% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)
%\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mshell}}]{Michael Shell}
% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:


% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.

%\vfill

% Can be used to pull up biographies so that the bottom of the last one
% is flush with the other column.
